## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` version ^1.6.1 to dependencies
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json

**2. Modified app/layout.tsx (Root Layout)**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
   - Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, and metadata

### Implementation Details

This is a Next.js App Router project (using the `app` directory), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `app/layout.tsx`. The component is placed inside the body tag to track page views across all routes in the application.

### Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ No linting errors introduced
- ✅ Lock file (package-lock.json) updated properly

The analytics will automatically track page views once the application is deployed to Vercel.
